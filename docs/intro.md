# Canon Guard

## Overview

Canon Guard works as the first line of defense for a SAFE Wallet.

### Features

- **Timelock**: all transactions must be executed after a certain amount of time, that can be lowered if the actions are pre-approved by the Safe.
- **Immutable actions**: all actions are immutable, meaning that they cannot be changed after they are queued.
- **Emergency mode**: in case of an emergency, the emergency mode can be activated to delegate the control of the Safe to another account.

### Getting started

Does not matter if you understand Solidity or not, it is recommended to start by reading the non-technical docs:

- [Technical docs](technical/)
